# unity3D-DefenderBuilder
An ongoing defender builder project. 

<b>Version 1:</b> Play the prototype of version 1 here: https://lamngo.itch.io/build-defense

<b>Version 2:</b> I'm currently working on version 2 of this prototype to include more gameplay functions (i.e. moving units by command, buildings that contain different unit types), A* pathfinding for units, etc. This version is inspired by the game `Shogun` developed by SEGA.
